# kpulse
kpulse is a project for keeping a pulse on .kp

First step is getting a comprehensive daily crawl of new content on kcna.kp going and monthly site-wide crawl.

Later steps are capturing other sites that use AJAX for dynamic CMS and are not traditionally crawlable described [here](https://izbicki.me/blog/fixing-north-korea-kcna-webpage.html).
